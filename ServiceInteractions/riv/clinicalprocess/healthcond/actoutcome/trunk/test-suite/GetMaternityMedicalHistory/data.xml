                before or after the given range.
            2. A record with AuthorTime within the given range, the DocumentTime and SignatureTime should
                before or after the given range.
            3. A record with SignatureTime within the given range, the DocumentTime and AuthorTime should
                before or after the given range.

            7. A record with SignatureTime, DocumentTime and AuthorTime within the given range.
            8. A record with SignatureTime, DocumentTime and AuthorTime outside the given range.
            The DocumentId's of case 1-7 should be added as a comma-separated list in the
                expectedDocumentIds field.
