        <description>Verifies that the result only contains information within the date boundaries for the given patient.
            This test will require at least eight VaccinationMedicalRecords:
            1. A record with DocumentTime within the given range, the AuthorTime and SignatureTime should
                before or after the given range.
            2. A record with AuthorTime within the given range, the DocumentTime and SignatureTime should
                before or after the given range.
            3. A record with SignatureTime within the given range, the DocumentTime and AuthorTime should
                before or after the given range.
            4. A record with DocumentTime and AuthorTime within the given range, the SignatureTime should
                before or after the given range.
            5. A record with DocumentTime and SignatureTime within the given range, the AuthorTime should
                before or after the given range.
            6. A record with SignatureTime and AuthorTime within the given range, the DocumentTime should
                before or after the given range.
            7. A record with SignatureTime, DocumentTime and AuthorTime within the given range.
            8. A record with SignatureTime, DocumentTime and AuthorTime outside the given range.
            The DocumentId's of case 1-7 should be added as a comma-separated list in the
                expectedDocumentIds field.
            The DocumentId's of case 8 should be added in the unexpectedDocumentIds field.
            The fields httpHeaderHsaId and logicalAddress should contain values that does not affect the list of CareContacts.
