This is a Windows bat file for generating .Net WCF service contracts (C#) and client proxies from the WSDL files.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose is to give producer- and consumer projects that use .Net and WCF a head-start for setting up the build system
to generate contract-first classes and interfaces for this service domain.

You need the .Net SDK to run the batfile. It's part of Visual Studio. You may also download it separately from this url
(the download support all windows versions from XP to Windows 7): http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dd299405.aspx

How to run the bat-file:

1) Install .Net SDK or Microsoft Visual Studio. Make sure the bin-directory of your .Net SDK installation is on your PATH ("SvcUtil.exe" is required)
2) Open a command window and "cd" to the directory where this howto-file is located.
3) Enter "generate-src-RIVTABP21.bat" on the commandline and process enter

The generated C# class file and the generated WCF app.config file will appear in a sub-directory created by the bat file called generated-src.
The generated cs-file contains C# interfaces for all service contracts (all wsdl-files).
