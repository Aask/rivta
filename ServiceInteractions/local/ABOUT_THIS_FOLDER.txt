The "local" folder contains service contracts that are not yet under national governance. They are likely to change in any aspect - even service domain. This is an aea where projects can add service contracts while they are still under elaboration. In this folder, service contracts may be hosted in a simpler structure than the what is required for nationally governed contracts.

Service contracts hosted in this folder are not allowed to be used in production.

This folder is where service contracts will be when they are first submitted for review by the architecture board.
